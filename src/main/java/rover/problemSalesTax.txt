PROBLEM TWO: SALES TAXES

"
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books,
food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional
sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no
exemptions."

---------
commentary:
sales tax and import tax are calculated on the basic price.

---------
"When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the
items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the
items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  The rounding rules for
sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains
(np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
"
--------
commentary:

notations are introduced:
n is the sales tax rate.
p is the shelf price.

sales tax is rounded to the nearest 0.05.
note that it is rounded up, never rounded down.
this is applicable for both basic tax and import tax

---------
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping
baskets...

---------

commentary:

ok. all clear.
so, shopping baskets must be accepted.

--------------

INPUT:

Input 1:
1 book at 12.49
1 music CD at 14.99
1 chocolate bar at 0.85

--------------
commentary:
each line above contains 
quantity, import status, item label, cost price, 
info about whether it is a food, book or medical product.

---------

Input 2:
1 imported box of chocolates at 10.00
1 imported bottle of perfume at 47.50

Input 3:
1 imported bottle of perfume at 27.99
1 bottle of perfume at 18.99
1 packet of headache pills at 9.75
1 box of imported chocolates at 11.25


OUTPUT

Output 1:
1 book : 12.49
1 music CD: 16.49
1 chocolate bar: 0.85
Sales Taxes: 1.50
Total: 29.83

-----------
commentary:
above, tax is calculated solely for the music CD 
and is added automatically 
to get that item's shelf price.

so, the total is just a sum of shelf prices.
the sales taxes item is printed seperately.
it is a sum of all sales taxes implicitly paid.
it is not part of the total.

---------

Output 2:
1 imported box of chocolates: 10.50
1 imported bottle of perfume: 54.65
Sales Taxes: 7.65
Total: 65.15

----------
commentary:
note that for the imported box of chocolates, 
basic sales tax is not added.
import duty, however is.

for the perfume, base price is 4750.
then, 475 basic sales tax is added.
then 240 rounded import tax is also added.

---------

Output 3:
1 imported bottle of perfume: 32.19
1 bottle of perfume: 20.89
1 packet of headache pills: 9.75
1 imported box of chocolates: 11.85
Sales Taxes: 6.70
Total: 74.68

---------

Initial ideas:

make clerk class.
an object of this class 
has a service method.
it accepts shopping basket objects.
an clerk object is created because, 
in the future, different clerk objects can 
have different behaviours and greetings.
for each shopping basket the clerk processes, 
the processShoppingBasket method is called.
Here, the clerk instantiates shoppingBaskets, 
the billItems in the shopping basket; 
as read from the string argument passed to it.
This method returns the output for that shopping basket.

make shopping-basket class.
a shopping basket 
is a collection of BillItem objects.
a seperate shopping-basket class 
is created 
instead of just using a collection 
because there may be future extentions.
The ShoppingBasket class contains 
a method to produce the final bill.

make Item class.
make ImportedItem subclass.
this subclass is created because, 
eventually, ImortedItem objects 
can hold extra data pertinent to the "imported" status.

make BasicSalesTaxExemtptedList interface.
make static lists of strings 
for which sales tax is exempted.
let there be a food-word list, 
medicine-word list and book-word list.

item object has a boolean flag 
to indicate whether basic sales tax 
is exempted.
it has a method to determine the above, 
using the BasicSalesTaxExemtptedList.
it also has the basic price variable, 
which is a long integer.
(all prices are stored in cents.)
it has the sales tax variable, initialised to 0.
it has an identifying label.

an item has methods 
to get and set its basic tax exemption status.
it has a method to calculate sales tax.
this method is overridden in the ImportedItem subclass.
it has a method to get the sales tax.
it has a method to get and set basic price.
it has a method to get shelf price.

make BillItem class.
this includes one Item object 
and an integer representing the quantity billed.
